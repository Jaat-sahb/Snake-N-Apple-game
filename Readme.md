# 🐍 Snake Game (Vanilla JS)

A small **Snake & Apple** game built using **HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript**.  
No frameworks, no canvas, no libraries — just DOM + CSS Grid.

Built mainly for fun and to practice basic game logic, DOM manipulation, and event handling.

---

## 🎮 How to play
- Use **Arrow keys / WASD** to move the snake
- Eat apples to grow
- Don’t hit the walls or yourself
- Game speed increases with levels

---

## 🚀 Run it
No setup required.

- Clone the repo
- Open `index.html` in your browser  
  *(or use VS Code Live Server)*

---

## 🧠 What this game uses
- CSS Grid for the board
- `setInterval` as the game loop
- Keyboard events for controls
- Dynamic DOM elements for snake & apple

---

## ⚠️ Notes
- This is a **small practice game**, not a polished project
- Code is intentionally simple and readable
- No canvas, physics engine, or heavy architecture

---

## 📌 Why this exists
I built this to:
- Understand game loops
- Practice DOM-based rendering
- Get comfortable handling state and user input

Nothing more, nothing less.

## 🛠️ Future ideas (maybe)
- Restart button
- Mobile controls
- High score using `localStorage`

No promises 😄
